  wmk is a flexible and versatile static site generator written in Python. It
  supports themes, SCSS, shortcodes and site search, and although it is
  primarily designed for Markdown or HTML content files, it can handle multiple
  input formats via Pandoc. wmk can be extended by writing hooks in Python,
  making it possible to override or modify most aspects of its operation. To
  get the source code, install the program, or contribute to the project,
  please take a look at the [GitHub repository](<https://github.com/bk/wmk>).
