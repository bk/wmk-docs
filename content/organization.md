## File organization

Inside a given working directory, `wmk` assumes the following subdirectories for
content and output. They will be created if they do not exist:

- `htdocs`: The output directory. Rendered, processed or copied content is
  placed here, and `wmk serve` will serve files from this directory.

- `templates`: Mako templates. Templates with the extension `.mhtml` are
  rendered directly into `htdocs` as `.html` files (or another extension if the
  filename ends with `.$ext\.mhtml`, where `$ext` is a string consisting of 2-4
  alphanumeric characters), unless their filename starts with a dot or
  underscore or contains the string `base`, or if they are directly inside a
  subdirectory named `base`. For details on context variables received by such
  stand-alone templates, see {{< linkto("Context variables") >}}.

- `content`: typically markdown (`*.md`) and/or HTML (`*.html*`) content with YAML
  metadata, although other formats are also supported. For a full list,
  see {{< linkto("Input formats") >}} above.
  - Markdown (or other supported content) will be converted into HTML and then
    "wrapped" in a layout  using the `template` specified in the metadata or
    `md_base.mhtml` by default.
  - HTML files inside `content` are assumed to be fragments rather than complete
    documents. Accordingly, they will be wrapped in a layout just like the
    converted markdown. In general, such content is treated just like markdown
    files except that the markdown-to-html conversion step is skipped.  For
    instance, shortcodes can be used normally, although they may not work as
    expected if they return markdown rather than HTML. (Complete HTML documents
    are best placed in `static` rather than `content`).
  - The YAML metadata may be (a) at the top of the md/html document itself,
    inside a frontmatter block delimited by `---`; (b) in a separate file with
    the same filename as the content file, but with an extra `.yaml` extension
    added; or (c) it may be in `index.yaml` files which are inherited by
    subdirectories and the files contained in them.
    For details, see {{< linkto("Site, page and nav variables") >}}.
  - The target filename will be `index.html` in a directory corresponding to the
    basename of the source file â€“ unless `pretty_path` in the metadata is `false`
    or the name of the file itself is `index.md` or `index.html` (in which case
    the relative path is remains the same, except that the extension is of
    course changed to `.html` if the source is a markdown file).
  - The processed content will be passed to the Mako template as a string in the
    context variable `CONTENT`, along with other metadata.
  - A YAML datasource can be specified in the metadata block as `LOAD`; the data
    in this file will be added to the context. For further details on the
    context variables, see {{< linkto("Context variables") >}}.
  - Files that have other extensions than `.md`, `.html` or `.yaml` will be
    copied directly over to the (appropriate subdirectory of the) `htdocs`
    directory.  This is so as to enable "bundling", i.e. keeping images and
    "attachments" together with related markdown files.

- `data`: YAML files for additional metadata. May be referenced in frontmatter
  data or used by templates. Other data files (CSV, SQLite, etc.) should
  typically also be placed here.

- `py`: Directory for Python files. This directory is automatically added to the
  front of `sys.path` before Mako is initialized, meaning that Mako templates
  can import modules placed here. Implicit imports are possible by setting
  `mako_imports` in the config file (see {{< linkto("Configuration file") >}}).
  There are also two special files that may be placed here: `wmk_autolaod.py` in
  your project, and `wmk_theme_autoload.py` in the theme's `py/` directory.  If
  one or both of these is present, wmk imports a dict named `autoload` from
  them. This means that you can assign `PREPROCESS` and `POSTPROCESS` page
  actions by name (i.e. keys in the `autoload` dict) rather than as function
  references, which in turn makes it possible to specify them in the frontmatter
  directly rather than having to do it via a shortcode. (For more on `PRE-` and
  `POSTPROCESS`, see {{< linkto("Site, page and nav variables") >}}).

- `assets`: Assets for an asset pipeline. The only default handling of assets
  involves compiling SCSS/Sass files in the subdirectory `scss`. They will be
  compiled to CSS which is placed in the target directory `htdocs/css`. Other
  assets handling can be configured via settings in the configuration file, e.g.
  `assets_commands` and `assets_fingerprinting`. This will be described in more
  detail in {{< linkto("Site, page and nav variables") >}}. Also take note of the
  `fingerprint` template filter, described in {{< linkto("Template filters") >}}.

- `static`: Static files. Everything in here will be rsynced directoy over to
  `htdocs`.
