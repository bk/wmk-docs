## Working with lists of pages

Templates which render a list of content files (e.g. a list of blog posts or
pages belonging to a category) will need to filter or sort `MDCONTENT`
accordingly. In order to make this easier, `MDCONTENT` is wrapped in a list-like
object called `MDContentList`, which has the following methods:

### General searching/filtering

Each of the following methods returns a new `MDContentList` containing those
entries for which the predicate (`pred`) is True.

- `match_entry(self, pred)`: The `pred` (i.e. predicate) is a callable which
  receives the full information on each entry in the `MDContentList` and returns
  True or False.

- `match_ctx(self, pred)`: The `pred` receives the context for each entry and
  returns a boolean.

- `match_page(self, pred)`: The `pred` receives the `page` object for each entry
  and returns a boolean.

- `match_doc(self, pred)`: The `pred` receives the markdown body for each entry
  and returns a boolean.

- `url_match(self, url_pred)`: The `pred` receives the `url` (relative to
  `htdocs`) for each entry and returns a boolean.

- `path_match(self, src_pred)`: The `pred` receives the path to the source
  document for each entry and returns a boolean.

### Specialized searching/filtering

All of these return a new `MDContentList` object (at least by default).

- `posts(self, ordered=True)`: Returns a new `MDContentList` with those entries
  which are blog posts. In practice this means those with markdown sources in
  the `posts/` or `blog/` subdirectories or those which have a `page.type` of
  "post", "blog", "blog-entry" or "blog_entry". Normally ordered by date (newest
  first), but this can be turned off by setting `ordered` to False.

- `not_posts(self)`: Returns a new `MDContentList` with "pages", i.e. those
  entries which are *not* blog posts.

- `has_slug(self, sluglist)`, `has_id(self, idlist)`: Entries with specific
  slugs/ids.

- `in_date_range(self, start, end, date_key='DATE')`: Posts/pages with a date
  between `start` and `end`. The key for the date field can be specifed using
  `date_key`.  Unless the value for `date_key` is either `DATE` or `MTIME`, then
  the key is looked for in the `page` variables for the entry.

- `has_taxonomy(self, haystack_keys, needles)`: A general search for entries
  belonging to a taxonomy group, such as category, tag, section or type. They
  `haystack_keys` are the `page` variables to examine while `needles` is a list
  of the values to look for in the values of those variables. A string value for
  `needles` is treated as a one-item list. The search is case-insensitive.

- `in_category(self, catlist)`: A shortcut method for
  `self.has_taxonomy(['category', 'categories'], catlist)`

- `has_tag(self, taglist)`: A shortcut method for `self.has_taxonomy(['tag',
  'tags'], taglist)`.

- `in_section(self, sectionlist)`: A shortcut method for
  `self.has_taxonomy(['section', 'sections'], sectionlist)`.

- `group_by(self, pred, normalize=None, keep_empty=False)`: Group items in an
  MDContentList using a given criterion. Parameters: `pred` is a callable
  receiving a content item and returning a string or a list of strings. For
  convenience, `pred` may also be specified as a string and is then interpreted
  as the value of the named `page` variable, e.g. `category`; `normalize` is an
  optional callable that transforms the grouping values, e.g. by truncating and
  lowercasing them; `keep_empty` should be set to True when the content items
  whose predicate evaluates to the empty string are to be included in the
  result, since they otherwise will be omitted. Returns a dict whose keys are
  strings and whose values are `MDContentList` instances.

- `page_match(self, match_expr, ordering=None, limit=None)`: This is actually
  quite a general matching method but does not require the caller to pass a
  predicate callable to it, which means that it can be employed in more varied
  contexts than the general methods described in the last section. A
  `match_expr` contains the filtering specification. It will be described
  further below. The `ordering` parameter, if specified, should be either
  `title`, `slug`, `url` or `date`, with an optional `-` in front to indicate
  reverse ordering. The `date` option for `ordering` may be followed by the
  preferred frontmatter date field after a colon, e.g.
  `ordering='-date:modified_date'` for a list with the most recently changed
  files at the top. The `limit`, if specified, obviously indicates the maximum
  number of pages to return.

- `page_match_sql()`, `get_db()`, `get_db_columns()` â€“ see "Searching/filtering
  using SQL" below.

A `match_expr` for `page_match()` is either a dict or a list of dicts.  If it is
a dict, each page in the result set must match each of the attributes specified
in it. If it is a list of dicts, each page in the result set must match at least
one of the dicts (i.e., the returned result set contains the union of all
matches from all dicts in the list). When a string or regular expression match
is being performed in this process, it will be case-insensitive. The supported
attributes (i.e. dict keys) are as follows:

- `title`: A regular expression which will be applied to the page title.
- `slug`: A regular expression which will be applied to the slug.
- `id`: A string or list of strings (one of) which must match the page id exactly.
- `url`: A regular expression which will be applied to the target URL.
- `path`: A regular expression which will be applied to the path to the markdown
  source file (i.e. the `source_file_short` field).
- `doc`: A regular expression which will be applied to the body of the markdown
  source document.
- `date_range`: A list containing two ISO-formatted dates and optionally a date
  key (`DATE` by default) - see the description of `in_date_range()` above.
- `has_attrs`: A list of frontmatter variable names. Matching pages must have a
  non-empty value for each of them.
- `attrs`: A dict where each key is the name of a frontmatter variable and the
  value is the value of that attribute. If the value is a string, it will be
  matched case-insensitively. All key-value pairs must match.
- `has_tag`, `in_section`, `in_category`: The values are lists of tags, sections
  or categories, respectively, at least one of which must match
  (case-insensitively). See the methods with these names above.
- `is_post`: If set to True, will match if the page is a blog post; if set to
  False will match if the page is not a blog post.
- `exclude_url`: The page with this URL should be omitted from the results
  (normally the calling page).

### Searching/filtering using SQL

An `MDContentList` has three methods for examining the content using an SQLite
in-memory database:

- `get_db(self)`: Builds a SQLite database containing a single table, `content`,
  whose structure is described below. Returns a connection to this database which
  can then be worked with using normal sqlite3/DBAPI methods. The database has a
  locale-sensitive collation called `locale` (which applies `locale.strxfrm`)
  and a custom function `casefold` (which simply applies the Python `casefold`
  string method). The row factory is `sqlite3.Row`, so row fields can be read
  using either column names or integer indices.

- `get_db_columns(self)`: Returns a simple list of the columns in the `content`
  table.

- `page_match_sql(self, where_clause=None, bind=None, order_by=None, limit=None,
  offset=None, raw_sql=None, raw_result=False, first=False)`: Either
  `where_clause` or `raw_sql` must be specified. In either case, if `bind` is
  specified, the bind variables there will be applied to the SQL upon execution.
  If `order_by` (a string), `limit` or `offset` (integers) are specified, they
  will be appended to the SQL before executing it against the database
  connection. The result will be a `MDContentList` unless `raw_result` is True,
  in which case it is a cursor object.  (If `raw_result` is False but `raw_sql`
  is supplied, the column list in the SQL select statement must include
  `source_file` so as to permit the construction of an appropriate
  `MDContentList`). If `first` is True, only the first item from the results
  is returned (or None, if the results are empty).

The `content` table constructed by `get_db()` always contains the columns
`source_file`, `source_file_short`, `url` `target`, `template`, `MTIME`, `DATE`,
`doc`, and `rendered`. In addition, it contains each `page` metadata field that
appears in any of the entries in the `MDContentList` in question. These will be
added as columns with the `page_` prefix; for instance, the `title` field will
become `page_title`.

It should be noted that all `page` fields added to the table will have to match
the regular expression `^[a-z]\w*$`. Thus, any metadata field with
a key that is all uppercase, titlecased, or contains non-word characters
(such as hyphens) will be omitted. Also, field names are case-sensitive in the
raw metadata, but case-insensitive in the database table, so inconsistently
capitalized field names may lead to unexpected results.

A field value that is not either string, integer, float, boolean, date, datetime,
or None, will be serialized using `json.dumps()` with `ensure_ascii` set to False
(for easier utf-8 matching). Dates and datetimes are stringified. Booleans will
be represented as 1 or 0.

### Sorting

All of these return a new `MDContentList` object with the entries in the
specified order.

- `sorted_by(self, key, reverse=False, default_val=-1)`: A general sorting
  method. The `key` is the `page` variable to sort on, `default_val` is the
  value to assume if there is no such variable present in the entry, while
  `reverse` indicates whether the sort is to be descending (True) or ascending
  (False, the default).

- `sorted_by_date(self, newest_first=True, date_key='DATE')`: Sorting by date,
  newest first by default. The date key to sort on can be specified if desired.

- `sorted_by_title(self, reverse=False)`: Sorting by `page.title`, ascending
  by default.

### Pagination

- `paginate(self, pagesize=5, context=None)`: Divides the `MDContentList` into
  chunks of size `pagesize` and returns a tuple consisting of the chunks and a
  list of `page_urls` (one for each page, in order). If an appropriate template
  context is provided, pages 2 and up will be written to the webroot output
  directory to destination files whose names are based upon the URL for the
  first page (and the page number, of course). Without the context, the
  `page_urls` will be None. It is the responsibility of the calling template to
  check the `_page` variable for the current page to be rendered (this defaults
  to 1). Each iteration will get all chunks and must use this variable to limit
  itself appropriately.

Typical usage of `paginate()`:

```mako
<%
  posts = MDCONTENT.posts()
  chunks, page_urls = posts.paginate(5, context)
  curpage = context.get('_page', 1)
%>

% for post in chunks[curpage-1]:
  ${ show_post(post) }
% endfor

% if len(chunks) > 1:
  ${ prevnext(len(chunks), curpage, page_urls) }
% endif
```

### Render to an arbitrary file

- `def write_to(self, dest, context, extra_kwargs=None, template=None)`:
  Calls a template with the `MDContentList` in `self` as the value of `CHUNK`
  and write the result to the file named in `dest`. The file is of course
  relative to the webroot.  Any directories are created if necessary. The
  `template` is by default the calling template while `extra_kwargs` may be
  added if desired.

Typical usage of `write_to()`:

```mako
<%
  if not CHUNK:
     for tag in tags:
         tagged = MDCONTENT.has_tag([tag])
         if not tagged:
             continue  # avoid potential infinite loop!
         outpath = '/tags/' + slugify(tag) + '/index.html'
         tagged.write_to(outpath, context, {'TAG': tag})
%>

% if CHUNK:
  ${ list_tagged_pages(TAG, CHUNK) }
% else:
  ${ list_tags() }
% endif
```
